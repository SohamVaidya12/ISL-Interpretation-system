# ISL-Interpretation-system
ISL Project- This project aims to bridge the communication gap be
tween the deaf and normal population by developing
 an ISL interpreter system. We successfully curated
 a vital dataset and implemented the key models.
 These models collectively demonstrated promising re
sults in translating short sign phrases to text, especially
 in emergency scenarios.
