The Indian Sign Language (ISL) Interpreter System bridges the communication gap between the hearing-impaired and non-signing individuals. It utilizes curated datasets and advanced models, including 3D CNN, CNN-LSTM, and object detection with cvzone, to translate short sign words into text in real time. This system addresses challenges in emergency communication and promotes accessibility.
