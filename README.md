# ISL-Interpretation-system
The Indian Sign Language (ISL) Interpreter System bridges the communication gap between the hearing-impaired and non-signing individuals. It utilizes curated datasets and advanced models, including CNN, and object detection with cvzone, to translate short sign words into text in real time. This system addresses challenges in emergency communication and promotes accessibility.

## Features
### 1. Hand Gesture Recognition
Utilizes neural networks to detect and recognize hand gestures in real-time, translating them into text.

### 2. Curated Dataset
A specialized dataset is created for accurate training and testing of sign language gestures, ensuring high performance.

### 3. Advanced Neural Models
- **CNN** for spatial feature extraction.  
- **cvzone Hand Tracking Module** for efficient gesture detection and tracking.

### 4. Real-Time Translation
Converts short ISL gestures into text quickly, reducing understanding time and enhancing communication.

### 5. Emergency Scenarios Support
Focused on translating critical gestures used during emergencies, ensuring effective communication.

### 6. Scalability
Designed to accommodate future enhancements, such as translating small phrases or integrating with educational platforms.
